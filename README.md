# Mpg123JNI
A Java Wrapper for the windows version of the [libmpg123](https://mpg123.de/). 

This library is not complete. The following functions are implemented: 

 * mpg123_init()
 * mpg123_new()
 * mpg123_open_feed()
 * mpg123_decode()
 * mpg123_getformat()
 * mpg123_delete()
 * mpg123_strerror()
 * mpg123_param()

This is an incomplete library that suits my needs for an audioplayer in java.  I may never add the missing functionality. Please feel free to fork and expand completion. It's not terribly hard to do once you've got a good work environment setup. 

As of September 2020, I intend to make sure this works in Linux as well.  Aside from that, I'm doing the minimial necessary implementation for my uses. Feel free to fork/expand/etc.
